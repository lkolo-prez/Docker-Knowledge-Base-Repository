# Docker Knowledge Base Repository

This repository serves as my knowledge base for Docker technology. It contains various Dockerfiles and related resources based on my experiences, covering different aspects of containerization. Here, you will find helpful information, best practices, and examples to aid in understanding and working with Docker.

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment and management of applications within lightweight, isolated containers. Containers provide a consistent and reproducible environment for running applications, ensuring they work seamlessly across different systems.

With Docker, you can package your application and its dependencies into a container image. These images can be easily distributed and run on any machine that has Docker installed, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem. Docker enables you to isolate your application's processes, control resource allocation, and simplify deployment across various environments.

## Examples

Here are a few simple examples to illustrate Dockerfile contents and commands commonly used in Docker:

1. **Simple Node.js Application** (Dockerfile):

```dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

2. **Build Image** (Command):

```bash
docker build -t my-app .
```

3. **Run Container** (Command):

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 my-app
```

Feel free to explore more Docker examples within this repository to learn and experiment with different containerization scenarios.
